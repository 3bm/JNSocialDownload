JNSocialDownload
======================

A Dead simple Facebook and Twitter avatar and cover downloader


#Getting Started
##Objc-c
============

1. Copy JNSocialDownload class into your project.
2. `socialDownload = [[JNSocialDownload alloc] init];`
3. `socialDownload.appID = YOUR_FACEBOOK_APP_ID` . If you have used FacebookSDK and you set the app id in the info.plist then this library is also able to get it from there
4. Download some data with `- (void)downloadAvatarForNetwork:(JNSocialDownloadNetwork)network completionHandler:(SocialDownloadImageBlock)completion ;` 


##Swift
============
1. Copy JNSocialDownload class into your project.
2. `var socialDownload = JNSocialDownload()`
3. `socialDownload.appID = YOUR_FACEBOOK_APP_ID` . If you have used FacebookSDK and you set the app id in the info.plist then this library is also able to get it from there
4. Download some data with `func downloadAvatar(ForNetwork network:JNSocialDownloadNetwork, completionHandler: SocialDownloadImageClosure) -> Void` 


Facebook APP ID
============
To use the native iOS facebook integration you need to create a facebok app id. 
The app id can be created here: https://developers.facebook.com , select "new app" and an ID will be created.



Considerations
============

The completion handler will be called in a background thread if you need to go back to the Main thread just call:
`
  dispatch_async(dispatch_get_main_queue(), ^{
    // DO SOMETHING WITH RESULT DATA
  });
        `
